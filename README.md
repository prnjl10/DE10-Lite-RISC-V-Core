# DE10-Lite-RISC-V-Core
Implements a 4-stage pipelined RV32I RISC-V CPU on the DE10-Lite (Intel MAX10 FPGA). Modular design with ALU, control, regfile, branch support, and dual-port memory. UART-TX mapped but unverified. Core synthesized, deployed, and runs benchmarks from memory. UART-based output pending serial debug.
